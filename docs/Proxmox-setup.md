# How to setup Proxmox VE 8.4

## Overview
The first thing you'll need to do is acquire hardware that can support several virtual machines.  
For this project, I used an old PC with an Intel i6-6600 3.3Ghz quad-core processor, 32GB of 2400Mhz DDR4 RAM, 500GB 2.5in. SATA SSD, and Intel Integrated Graphics.  
You'll need something similar to this with not necessarily the same amount of RAM, but having multiple cores to support multiple VMs is important.
